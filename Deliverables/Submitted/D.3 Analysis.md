# D.3 Analysis

## 1. System Description

RNT-A-ROOM aims to solve the problem of the lack of housing dedicated to **travel nurses** as it affects travel nursing agencies, hospitals (especially those in rural areas), landlords, and patients. Our audience is **travel nurses**with housing needs in the United States. **Travel nurses** have specific housing needs such as: flexible leases (short term, long term), family and pet accommodations, safety and security (they will be staying in unfamiliar *locations*), and proximity to healthcare facilities. By targeting this audience, RNT-A-ROOM can focus its services on meeting the unique requirements of **travel nurses**, which in turn will provide value and address their specific plan. The impact of which is staffing issues, quality of care, and tenant turnover. For **travel nurses** who need housing, RNT-A-ROOM is a housing web application that focuses on comfort and safety for **travel nurses** across America; Unlike FurnishedFinder and AirBnB, our product focuses on **travel nurses** needs. RNT-A-ROOM is a housing web application that caters to **travel nurses** in the United States and their needs. RNT-A-ROOM offers comfort and safety on an easy-to-use platform that verifies **user** and housing options.

RNT-A-ROOM focuses on our **user**, competitors, and detractors. Our main **user** for the system are **travel nurses** and **property owner**s. Our competitors are other vacation rental companies such as FurnishedFinders, AirBnb, and Vrbo, which feature **listings** that are already furnished, but were not made specifically for **travel nurses** in mind. Travel nursing agencies with pre existing housing may also be one of our main competitors. Some of our biggest detractors are those who are looking to have long-term leases. Other detractors include students in college looking for housing, and those looking for a vacation rental. With all the stakeholders listed, there are a handful of features to support our system for our stakeholders.

We have several requirements that we must meet in order to consider RNT-A-ROOM to be functional. First, RNT-A-ROOM should have a homepage. This homepage should load within 3 seconds to provide a fast a responsive  **user**  experience. Next, working hand-in-hand, we have the  **user**  profile and the  **user**  verification. The  **user**  profile will display 5  **user**  descriptions: *their user ID, full legal name, email, phone number, and verifiable certification*. The  **user**  verification, on the other hand, will verify if the  **user**  is a **travel nurse** or professional **property owner** by asking for proof of being a registered nurse or proof of a safe and valid housing. RNT-A-ROOM also requires a **listing** page with a working filtering system. Before the property owner will ***list*** open vacancies in their home, they will provide their *housing certification*. This **listing** page will display 5 different **listings** for the  **user**  to choose from. The filtering system will make it easier for the  **user** to find their perfect **listing**. It will reduce by several requirements that the  **user**  can enter: the number of beds, the length of the lease, the *location* (through city name or zipcode), and the *price* range. Lastly, RNT-A-ROOM needs to allow **user** to ***book*** a **listing**. The booking feature will maintain a 99.5% booking success rate for all hours of the website.

Our system will display a variety of behaviors such as booking a **listing**. Our tenants (**travel nurses**) will be looking for housing the moment the *agency* gives the **travel nurse** an assignment. Before the booking process can begin, the tenants will be required to ***create*** a  **user**  profile and get it approved through our verification system. After geting approved, the tenants will need to search through our **listings** using the filter system in order to find the ideal housing for their needs. After booking, the lease agreement will be reviewed by **property owner** and **travel nurse**. From there, travel nurses can choose the *type* of transaction and the **payment** can be *confirmed*. Alternatively, if the  **user**  finds that their lease agreement with the **property owner** isn’t correct then the  **user**  will have the opportunity to change the information and submit for it to be reconfirmed by the **property owner**. 

As mentioned above, tenants would be required to create an account for our systems. Not only tenants but also  **property owners** will be required to create an account but on a separate portal. Those who may want to use our services, such as a **travel nurse** or a **property owner**, will all be required to create an account. Once the account is created, this use case is completed. **user** will need to open the website and register the account. After being verified through our system, the  **user** account is then created and saved in our system; otherwise, the  **user** account is not created due to verification failure. 

In order to find the appropriate housing, the tenants might feel the need to use our filtering system because they want a specific housing environment. The  **user** must have a verified account in order to access the **listing** but once the account is verified then the  **user** will be able to use filters to view the *available* listings, their total *price*, and rate break downs. In most cases, **user** will have their account verified and will be able to use the filters to help them find the **listing** they want to book. Worse case, those who have a verified account but can not use the filter system are most likely running into an error.

In order to support the **travel nurse** community, giving them the ability to share their experiences with a properties that they have stayed at will help other nurses feel more comfortable. Those who want to ***create*** a **review** and a *rating* will be required to have a verified stay at one of the properties. They will have the opportunity to view their past stays and select the one they want to leave a **review** and a *rating* about. By adding *comments* and posting the **review**, this will allow our **travel nurses** to select a high quality stay for their needs. If there is an issue, there is a chance that the  **user** is not in their account or might have lost their password to the account and will be required to click on “forget password” to reset it.  

RNT-A-ROOM not only benefits **travel nurses** and their agencies, but also **property owners** and hospitals. It gives both **travel nurses** and **property owner** ease of mind by having a secure user base. **property owner** can rest assure knowing that their clients will be trusted registered **travel nurses**. Meanwhile, **travel nurses** won’t have to worry about deciding whether or not the booking that they choose is reliable or not because all of our bookings are verified properties. **Travel nurses** can use the filtering system to, for example, find **listings** with low *crime rates* or enough **rooms** to house their entire families. They can also  **user** our **review** system to both decide on their next property and provide other **travel nurses** help on deciding their own next **listing**. RNT-A-ROOM also gives **travel nurses** the ability to cancel a lease, so that **property owner** are not left waiting for their new tenant to arrive. On top of all of this, RNT-A-ROOM shows its **user** all of the amenities that a **listing** will have such as *gyms*, *grocery store*, and disability accommodations. RNT-A-ROOM strives to provide a high quality service for our **user** by thinking through the  **user** ’s perspectives.
