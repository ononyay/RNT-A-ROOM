      - Landlord with 4 Rental Properties
      Key Insights from the Interview
      - Having Short Term Tenants are a hassle because you have to clean up after each tenant so often and finding another one is the hardest part. So when your property has no tenant, you make no money.
      Quotes
      -"Short-term tenants are tiring. I prefer people who can stay there for longer because for short term tenants I have to clean up after them so often"
      -"People who live short-term you need to charge them a lot more because you have to think about your time. Because you have to find people after they leave and that's losing money. You also need to clean up more often if you are constantly having short tenants"
      -"Finding new people to live in your rental properties is probably the only hard part."
      Assessment: Must Have/ Nice to Have/Don't Care (how the interviewee sees the solution)

      Customer Segment?
      - NP and Landlord
      Key Insights from the Interview
      - In planning your arrangements, you need to be on time. Put in consideration that you need a good housing place, cost, convenience of commuting to work, and the safety of the environment.
      - Flexible cancellation policy is a good thing to have as a policy, so you can have a limitation in time for cancellations and in that case you have to establish a time frame for refunds, as well as the amount.
      - Most travel nurses commute to their assignments by using their own car, there are many other options depending on where their assignment location is, if it's a rural area with not much public transportation, the best option is to take your car. 
      Quotes
      - "If I was a traveling nurse, I’d like not to get involved with cutting grass and take care of outside, just take care of my room/kitchen. If all the people that rent, let's say there are other nurses, they may decide to pay someone to do their cleaning for them. For me, I’d like the landlord or housing agent to take care of outside cleaning, not my room, “I can manage my room”."
      - "You may like things like gym, groceries,local hospitals and clinics, to be around the place without going too far. That's the convenience of housing."
      - "Are you someone that likes to share? Share the kitchen, cost of the housing, like electricity, water and stuff like that. Some people have the desire to have a small case: just get a room, for people who like privacy; they can rent an apartment for themselves."
      - "Depending on the agency you are working for, if they try to pay for housing for you and if it's cheaper, go for it. If you like convenience and privacy, you can consider all these factors like safety, commute time, facilities, safety yourself which is a part of planning or ask questions from your agency."

      Key Insights from the Interview
      - Travel nurses don't have a specific age range. No age limit, as long as they have the license to practice and experience.

Percent of travel nurses female 84% and male 16%.
      - They can find housing through agencies and ask questions, get information from hospital or healthcare facility they are going to, from friends and co travelers. They can go to websites and mention airbnb, travelnursehousing.com, they can ask for assistance from other nurses as well.
      - It's easier to find housing in urban areas, there are so many hospitals and houses/hotels and facilities or amenities. As in rural areas, you may get an assignment and may not have the kind of housing you may want to have close to the healthcare facility that you are going. 
      Quotes
      - "The agency can assign housing arrangements based on assignments, and most of the time it's a short assignment".
      - "Job affects housing location, you need to have a contract for a job then you can start looking for housing."
      - "Wanting furnished or unfurnished housing depends on the individual. Some just want a room with a bed with kitchen/bathroom access that they can share with other people. Others may like luxury housing, in that case they may decide to stay in a hotel. Some people prefer private, some people prefer shared spaces".
